# Aquene child theme

The Aquene child theme is a starter blank child theme for the <a href="https://themesharbor.com/downloads/aquene/" target="_blank">Aquene WordPress theme</a>.

## Renaming *(optional)*

By default, GitHub adds "master" to the text of the zip file. You can rename the **zip** file of the child theme, so it is not called *aquene-child-master.zip*. It's better to have a folder that is called **aquene-child** rather than **aquene-child-master** because it makes more sense :)

## Installation

1. Download the child theme from this GitHub repository by clicking on a green button that says **Clone or download**. Once it's clicked, the page will show a modal window where you need to click **Download ZIP** in order to download a zip file.
1. Navigate to WordPress > Appearance > Themes > Add New.
1. Click **Upload Theme** and **Choose File**, then select the theme's .zip file. Click **Install Now**.
1. Click **Activate** to use your child theme.
